                <p>
                    Being born in a time where things such as the interent and gaming were just starting to become mainstream allowed me
                    to see thing, which were once niche and hard to come by, rapidly develop into things that have become ubiquitous
                    to our modern lives. It is this perspective that has allowed me to maintain an appreciation of modern technology and
                    not take it for granted. It also means that I have the opportunity to enter into a rapidly growing industry, an opportunity I
                    intend to make full use of.
                </p>

                    I've come to RMIT to develop and hone the skill's I'll need in order to break into the IT industry. I chose RMIT as I've had friends who've
                    attended and were happy and content with their choice. The campus is also in a convinent area, I live only 15 minutes away from the Melbourne CBD
                    so reducing the amount of travel time needed to attend my classes help inform my decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I expect to learn in this course are a variety and broad set of skills and knowledge ie. how networks work, hardware, how data is stored
                    and retrieved ect. A broad understanding is my goal as it will give me a good framework to enter a variety of fields in the industry,
                    from there I can explore my options and see where I go from there. The skills I'm most interested in learning is programming as from what little
                    I've dabbled in so far has been enjoyable and I like the problem solving nature of the field.
