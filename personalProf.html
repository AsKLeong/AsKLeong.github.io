                <p><b>Myers-Briggs:</b> INFP-t (Mediator)   <b>Learning Style Test:</b> Visual    <b>Mechanical Aptitude Test:</b> 9/10</p>
                <p>
                    The test results show that suggest that I learn more from being able to have a concrete idea of what I'm being taught. The Myer-Briggs results
                    also suggest that I'm prone to using metaphors are similes, perhaps this is the result of trying to use already known concepts to explain
                    more abstract notions. When I'm in a team I may need to understand the intent behind what ever task we're accomplishing as the Myer-Briggs
                    result suggest that I am driven more on principles and morals, so I will be more motivated if there is a good goal for my work. The resuts also
                    suggest that I may be strongly affected by interpersonal discord and struggle when needing to interact with a large amount of people. With this
                    knowledge I would suggest that I be placed in a small team who all work well with each other, I would also suggest having a team leader who 
                    can focus my attention to specific task as I may be prone to becoming distracting by my own thoughts.
