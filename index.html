                        <div class="content">
                            <div class="inner">
                                <h1 class="major">My Project Idea</h1>
                                <h2 class="major">The Bluetooth Hub App</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The project idea I'm presenting here is for a phone application which can control which bluetooth devices connect with each other i.e laptops, headphones, smart-watches ect.
                                    The app will store the devices which are paired with the phone and from the app you can see the status of the devices, such as which are paired with each other and whether or not a device is currently
                                    searching for a pair. The application will be able to tell 2 devices which already have been paired to connect to each other and will also be able to tell a device to disconnect to
                                    it's pair.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The impetus behind this project comes from the removal of the headphone jack in most smart phones, it is because of this that consumers are put into an awkward position.
                                    Where once if you had a corded headphone you could quickly connect to diffrent devices as needed i.e from your phone to your laptop or gaming device, now you are
                                    either required to purchase off putting dongles which bar you from using the port for other uses such as charging or connecting to a computer,
                                    or use wireless headphones which have a clunky process of switching connections as you must go into each devices setting to re-connect. While there may be other uses for an application
                                    such as this i.e for speaker system ect. this is is the primary drive behind this app.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The application will be installed onto a phone with permission to access the devices the phone is paired with. There will also need to be a program installed onto some
                                    of the other devices you wish to manage such as laptops and other smart-phones, this enables the application to communicate and control the other devices which is
                                    the basis of it's entire functionality. The application will show the status of the bluetooth devices paired to the phone and all the bluetooth devices paired with devices which
                                    have the partner application installed. The status will show if they're connected, what they're connected to and if it is turned off or on, (if possible it will also show the battery levels of devices) from here
                                    the user will be able to make connections or disconnections between valid devices. The application can only access what the devices with the partner application have,
                                    so only devices which are remembered will be manipulated by this application. If possible we may expand the functionality of the app so that it can also see potential bluetooth devices in the
                                    are and finish the pairing proccess from the app itself.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The application is fully software based and uses prexisting hardware to work, the device this application and its partner apps will of course need to be bluetooth capable. The software needed must be
                                    iOS, Android and Windows functionable at the very least with other systems such as Linux being considered depending on the success of the project. Knowledge of the capabilitys and function of
                                    bluetooth will be needed to create this app, the viability of this project is still in question, and beyond that skills in cross platform development is a must have for this application. An understanding of how
                                    bluetooth is recived and outputted is key to making this project work and this knowledge of the hardware must be backed by a strong programming skillset to write the application into existance. The scope of
                                    the project is difficulty to predict at this moment as without the knowledge on the inner workings of the systems which the application with be manipulating all projections will all be mostly
                                    guesswork.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                   Should this project become a success then the problem outline above about the hassle of manageing multiple bluetooth device will not be completely solves but at the very least it will be mitigated some,
                                    the user will be able make the changes they need to the current connections from a single device rather than needing to disconnect and reconnect over 2 or more. If this application or something like
                                    it does become popular enough it may cause hardware developers to make their devices compatible with the app as currently all the functionality is places on it's ability to work with devices which have 
                                    the ability to add diffrent programs onto them i.e. smart phones and computers. This change will further streamline the process.
